This repository is dedicated for students (or anyone) starting to train problem solving for competitions such as XCPC's or similar and contests such that on [codeforces](https://codeforces.com/).
It contains problems on almost every topic you would like to train on

> [!IMPORTANT]  
All Solutions are compiled and tested on C++20 (C++20 (GCC 13-64))

## How to follow up with this?
Just make sure to try solving each problem first and do not see the solutions until you do your best.
Good luck!
